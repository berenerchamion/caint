For this to work you need a .env file in your project root that contains your Google keys:

This project makes extensive use of Google Firebase.

This is my first project with Firebase so if you  are looking for a great set of sample code, this probably isn't it. 

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your key
FIRESTORE_COLLECTION_ID=your key

You will need to generate your google-services.json from the Firebase console and add it to the
android/app folder.
